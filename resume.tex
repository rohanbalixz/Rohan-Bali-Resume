% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\section{Academic Projects}

\runsubsection{Disaster Risk Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery - NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed and deployed a deep learning segmentation model for real-time flood detection using satellite imagery.
\item Leveraged a U-Net architecture with a ResNet backbone and robust pre-processing (normalization, augmentation, color conversion) to improve detection accuracy by 20\%.
\item Evaluated model performance with IoU (0.78) and Dice Score (0.82) metrics, ensuring precise delineation of flood-affected regions. Integrated the model with Triton Inference Server for scalable, low-latency inference in disaster monitoring scenarios.

\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Deep Learning for Historical Document Restoration and Analysis}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a U-Net-based deep learning model to restore degraded historical document images, achieving improvements in visual clarity by 96\%. \item Implemented an OCR pipeline with TensorFlow and Tesseract for accurate text extraction from restored documents and used NLP techniques
(LSTM) to classify document types with 87\% accuracy.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{\runsubsection{Movie Recommendation System Using NLP and Machine Learning}}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Achieved an efficient recommendation pipeline by removing stop words, tokenizing metadata, and optimizing the feature space with the 5000 most frequent words.
\item Engineered a Bag of Words model using CountVectorizer to transform textual data into numerical vectors. Computed cosine similarity to measure movie similarities.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{BOSTON REAL ESTATE PRICE PREDICTION}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Built different Regression models for 10,000 properties for the
prediction of prices, improving prediction accuracy by 15\%.
\item Engineered custom features like proximity to amenities, improving
model performance by 12\% for the price prediction.
\item Evaluated the model with MAE: 2.5 and RMSE: 3.2
