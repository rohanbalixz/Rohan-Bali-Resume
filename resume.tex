\begin{rSection}{PROJECTS}
\vspace{-1.25em}
\item \textbf{Road Safety Analysis Using Machine Learning} {The Road Safety Analysis project for Indian highways, diverse machine learning models were employed.Through predictive analytics, they assessed variables such as traffic volume, road conditions, accident history, and weather patterns to identify highways with the lowest risk of accidents, aiding in strategic road planning and safety enhancement measures.}
\item \textbf{Movie Recommendation System.} {Harnessing data from 5000 movies on TMDB, I implemented a Bag of Words model for natural language processing. Utilizing vectorization techniques like TF-IDF, the system generates five tailored movie recommendations based on your selection. This method enhances accuracy and personalization.}
\item \textbf{Boston Real Estate Price Prediction Syste} {The Boston Housing Price Prediction project aims to forecast housing prices using advanced machine learning techniques. The dataset includes 506 entries with 14 attributes, such as crime rate, number of rooms, and building age. This project outlines steps from data exploration to model deployment.}
\item \textbf{Used Cars Price Prediction System} {The Car Price Prediction Model employs Linear Regression, a fundamental and widely-used statistical method, to estimate the market value of used cars. This model predicts car prices based on various input features such as car brand, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, and kilometers driven.}
